## Contact me

I hold a deep commitment to the education of young students (from kindergarten to undergrad), which is a matter I take very seriously. If you need any help with math or ML, feel free to reach out! 

I am also totally open to any discussion not only related to natural language processing and machine learning in general, but also in array-oriented functional programming languages (e.g. J & APL) and Civilization VI. Please let me buy you coffee or bubble tea (beer even better)if you are around NYC :D
